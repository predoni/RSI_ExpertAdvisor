# RSI_ExpertAdvisor
RSI Expert Advisor created with MQL5 from MetaQuotes.net

This expert advisor is using an RSI indicator to spot the moments when you have to make investments on a forex market.
Has very good testing results and will get into production on November 15, 2020.
The broker will be RoboForex.com.
I will use an ECN account with leverage 300:1 and I will invest 10 Euro.
Up to this moment, I had a minimum of 1% per day profit.

Quick questions and answers:

Q: How much money have you invested to trade with this expert advisor?

A: I will invest 10 Euro starting with November 15, 2020. At this date, I will consider that the testing period has ended on demo accounts and is ready for production.

Q: Is 1% a good percentage?

A: Yes, is at least 20 percent per month. Not many companies make 20% per month.

Q: Why do you invest only 10 Euro?

A: Please, make yourself a favor.
Do not believe everyone that tells you: Small money is your enemy!
They are wrong!
If you can make 1 million with 10K? 
Why you cannot make it with 10 Euro?
So..., take it easy, small money saves you from failure.

Q: This 1% is the maximum percentage?

A: No, this is the minimum I had during testing on the demo account.
I had between 23% and 1% in one day.
The 1% daily is the value I consider is worth to take into consideration for long term investments.

Q: How many losses you had?

A: None, BUT! I tested this only on the demo account! It will be in production from November 15, 2020.

Q: When you will have a stable release, tested in production?

A: According to my calendar: May 15, 2021. After 6 months in production with the RoboForex-ECN account, leverage 300:1.

Q: What profit do you think will have in these 6 months?

A: With 1% per day will be a maximum of 33 Euro.
BUT! I hope it will be a medium of 5% per day and I will have 3500 Euro.

Q: Why do you share this project with everyone?

A: Strategy! If a big enough number of traders, throws orders in the same direction at the same time, then it is possible to move the market, in the desired direction, and to make a profit for the long term.

Thank you.
